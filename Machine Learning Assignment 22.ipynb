    "Sol: It is possible to speed up training of bagging, pasting, and random forests because each predictor is independent of the others.\n",

    "Sol: Each predictor in a bagging ensemble is evaluated using instances it was not trained on. This creates an unbiased eval of the ensemble without the need for a validation set. You can have more instances for training, and your ensemble can perform slightly better.\n"
